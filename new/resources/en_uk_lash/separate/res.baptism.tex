The Priest unties the girdle of the one who is about to be enlightened and divests them of outer clothing and shoes. He stands them facing East, wearing only a tunic, unbelted, bareheaded and barefoot, with the hands down. He breathes on their face three times, signs the forehead and breast three times.

In your name, O Lord God of truth, and of your Only-Begotten Son and your Holy Spirit, I place my hand on the head of your servant N., who has been counted worthy to take refuge in your holy Name and to be guarded under the shelter of your wings. Remove from him/her that ancient error and fill him/her with faith in you, and hope and love, so that he/she may know that you alone are God, true God, and your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and your Holy Spirit. Grant that he/she may walk in your commandments and preserve those things that are pleasing to you, for if someone does them, they will live by them. Inscribe him/her in your book of life and unite him/her to the flock of your inheritance. Let your holy Name and that of your beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ and of your life-giving Spirit, be glorified in him/her. Let your eyes remain ever fixed in mercy on him/her, and your ears to hear the voice of his/her supplication. Make him/her glad in the works of his/her hands and in all his/her race, that he/she may confess you, worshipping and glorifying your great and most high Name, and may praise you throughout all the days of his/her life. For every power of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

The Lord rebukes you, O Devil, the Lord who came into the world and dwelt among mortals so that he might destroy your tyranny and deliver humanity; the Lord who on the Tree crushed the hostile powers, when the sun was darkened, the earth shaken, the graves opened and the bodies of Saints arose; the Lord who by death abolished death and destroyed the one who had the power of death, that is you, the Devil. I adjure you by God, who revealed the tree of life and set in place the Cherubim and the flaming sword which turned this way and that to guard it: Be rebuked and withdraw! I adjure you by the One who walked on the surface of the sea as on dry land and rebuked the tempest of the winds, the One whose gaze dries up the deeps and whose curse melts mountains. For it is he who now commands you, through us: Be afraid, come out, withdraw from this creature and return no more. Do not hide in him/her, nor encounter him/her, nor influence him/her either by night or day, early or at noon. But go back to your own Tartarus until the great day of the judgement that has been prepared. Be afraid of God, who is seated upon the Cherubim and looks upon the deeps; before whom Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Authorities, Powers, the many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim tremble; before whom heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them tremble. Come out, and withdraw from the sealed and newly-enlisted soldier of Christ our God. For it is by him that I adjure you, the One who walks on the wings of the winds, who makes his Angels spirits and his ministers a flaming fire. Come out, and withdraw from this creature with all your power and your angels. For the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit has been glorified, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

It is God, the Holy One, who is beyond understanding and unsearchable in all his works and in his strength, the One who foreordained for you, O Devil, the penalty of eternal damnation, that through us, his unprofitable servants, orders you, and every power that works with you, to depart from the one who has been newly sealed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God. I adjure you, most evil, unclean, foul, abominable and alien spirit, by the power of Jesus Christ, who has all authority in heaven and on earth and who said to the deaf and dumb demon, ‘Come out of the man, and enter him no more!’ Depart! Acknowledge the futility of your power, which had no authority even over swine. Remember the One who ordered you, in accordance with your own request, to enter the herd of swine. Fear God, at whose command the earth was established upon the waters, who created the heavens and fixed the mountains with a king post and the valleys with a cross-beam, placed sand as a boundary for the sea and made a safe path through wild water; who touches the mountains and they smoke; who wraps himself in light as in a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth; who roofs his upper chambers with waters; who established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved for to age on age; who summoned the water of the sea and poured it out upon the face of the earth. Come and depart from one who is being made ready for holy Enlightenment. I adjure you by the saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, by his precious Body and Blood and his dread Coming; for he will come, and he will not delay, to judge the whole earth and he will condemn you and the power that works with you to the Gehenna of fire, handing you over to the exterior darkness, where the worm is unsleeping and the fire is not quenched. Because the might is Christ our God's, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

From four elements you composed the world, with four seasons you crowned the circle of the year. All the spiritual Powers tremble before you. The sun sings your praise, the moon glorifies you, the stars entreat you, the light obeys you, the deeps tremble before you, the springs are your servants. You stretched out the heaven like a curtain; you established the earth on the waters; you walled in the sea with sand; you poured out the air for breathing. Angelic Powers minister to you, the choirs of Archangels worship you, the many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim, as they stand and fly around you, veil themselves in fear of your unapproachable glory. For you, God uncircumscribed, without beginning and ineffable, came upon earth taking the form of a slave, being found in the likeness of mortals. For through the compassion of your mercy, Master, you could not endure to watch the human race being tyrannized by the devil, but you came and saved us. We confess your grace, we proclaim your mercy, we do not conceal your benevolence. You set at liberty the generations of our nature, you sanctified a virgin womb by your birth. All creation sang your praise when you appeared. For you, our God, were seen on earth and lived among mortals.

We pray you, Lord, let all airy and invisible specters withdraw from us, and do not let a demon of darkness hide itself in this water, and do not let an evil spirit, bringing darkening of thoughts and disturbance of mind, go down into it with the one who is being baptized. But do you, Master of all things, declare this water to be water of redemption, water of sanctification, cleansing of flesh and spirit, untying of bonds, forgiveness of offences, enlightenment of soul, washing of rebirth, renewal of spirit, gift of adoption, garment of incorruption, source of life. For it was you, Lord, who said, ‘Wash and be made clean, and put away evils from your souls’. It is you who have given us the grace of rebirth from on high through water and Spirit. Manifest yourself, Lord, in this water, and grant that the one being baptized in it may be transformed for the putting off of the old self that is corrupted after the desires of deception, and may put on the new that is renewed after the image of the One who created him/her. So that, planted in the likeness of your death through Baptism, he/she may also become a partaker in your Resurrection, and having guarded the gift of the Holy Spirit and increased the deposit of grace, may receive the prize of his/her high calling and be numbered with the firstborn, whose names are inscribed in heaven, in you our God and Lord, Jesus Christ. Because to you belong glory, might, honour and worship, together with your Father who is without beginning and your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

I said, ‘Against myself I will admit my iniquity to the Lord’, and you forgave the ungodliness of my heart. For this every holy one will pray to you at a fitting moment. Except in a flood of many waters they will not come near him. For you are my refuge from the affliction which surrounds me, my joy to deliver me from those who have surrounded me. ‘I will make you understand and guide you in the way in which you should go. I will fix my eyes upon you. Do not become like horse and mule, who have no understanding.

Brethren, as many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death. We were buried then with him through baptism to death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For one who has died has been justified from sin. If then we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer lords it over him. As to dying, he died once and for all; as to living, he lives for God. Consequently, you also must consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
