Master and Lord of hosts, our God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is seated on the Cherubim, and praised in hymns by the Seraphim; who dwell on high and survey the lowly; who make the sun rise on the evil and the righteous, and make the rain fall on the just and the unjust; who with ineffable power and wisdom uphold and govern all creation and all that has breath; who chastise and then heal again: Accept me as I approach your goodness and do not despise me the sinner; but hear the voice of my petition, and send help from your holy dwelling place, showing compassion for the creation of your hands, you who listen to the prayers of all, and heal your servant (N) from the illness which afflicts him (her).
