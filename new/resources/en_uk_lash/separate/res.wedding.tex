After the divine Liturgy, with the Priest standing in the Sanctuary, those who are to be joined take their stand before the Holy Doors, with the man on the right and the woman on the left. On the right side of the Holy Table are placed their two rings, one of gold and the other of silver. The silver one towards the right and the gold towards the left, close to each other. The Priest, having come into the narthex, signs the heads of those who are to be married three times and gives them lighted candles. He leads them into the Church and censes in the form of a cross.

Lord our God, you journeyed with the servant of the Patriarch Abraham in Mesopotamia when he was sent to obtain a wife for his lord Isaac, and by means of drawing water you revealed that he should betroth Rebecca. Bless the betrothal of your servants N. and M. and make firm the word that they have spoken. Confirm them with the holy unity that comes from you. For it was you who in the beginning created male and female, and it is by you that woman is linked to man as a helper and for the continuation of the human race. Therefore, Lord our God, who sent truth out to your inheritance and your promise to your servants, our fathers, your elect in every generation, look on your servant N. and your servant M., and make firm their betrothal in faith and concord and truth and love. For it is you, Lord, who declared that times a pledge is to be given and made firm in everything. By a ring authority was given to Joseph in Egypt. By a ring Daniel was glorified in the country of Babylon. By a ring the truth of Thamar was revealed. By a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion to the prodigal son. For he said, ‘Put a ring on his hand and bring out and slay the fatted calf, and let us eat and be joyful’. It was your right hand, Lord, that armed Moses at the Red Sea, for through your true word the heavens were made firm and the earth set on its foundations. And the right hand of your servants will be blessed by your mighty word and by your upraised arm. Therefore, Master, with your heavenly blessing now bless also this putting-on of rings. And may an Angel of the Lord go before them all the days of their lives. For you are the One who blesses and sanctifies all things, and to you we give glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

God most pure, Author of all creation, through your love for mankind you transformed the rib of our forefather Adam into a woman and blessed them saying, ‘Increase and multiply and have dominion over the earth’, and declared them both to be one through wedlock, ‘for because of this a man will abandon his father and mother and be attached to his own wife, and the two shall become one flesh’ and ‘those whom God has joined together, let no human separate’. <br> You blessed your servant Abraham and opened Sara’s womb, making him the father of many nations. <br> You gave Isaac to Rebecca and blessed her offspring. <br> You joined Jacob with Rachel and from him revealed the Twelve Patriarchs. <br> You yoked together Joseph and Aseneth and gave them as the fruit of their union Ephraim and Manassee. <br> You accepted Zachary and Elisabeth and declared their offspring to be the Forerunner. <br> You made the Ever-Virgin spring from the root of Jesse according to the flesh, and from her you became incarnate and were born for the salvation of the human race. <br> Through your ineffable gift and great goodness you were present in Cana of Galilee and blessed the marriage there, to show that lawful wedlock and the begetting of children that comes from it is your will. <br> All-holy Master, accept the entreaty of us, your suppliants, and, as you were present there, be present here also with your invisible protection. <br> Bless this marriage and grant to these servants of yours, N. and M., a peaceful life, length of days, chastity, love for each other in the bond of peace, long-lived offspring, grace in their children and an unfading crown of glory. <br> Grant that they may see their children’s children. <br> Preserve their marriage bed unassailed. <br> Give them of the dew of heaven from on high and of the richness of the earth. <br> Fill their houses with wheat, wine and oil and every good thing, so that they may also share them with those in need. <br> Grant also to those here with them all their requests that are for salvation. Because you are a God of mercy and compassion and love for humankind, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

}%
\itKey{p0141}{
Blessed are you, Lord our God, sacred Celebrant of the mystical and most pure marriage, Lawgiver of bodily marriage, Guardian of incorruption, loving Steward of our livelihood. In the beginning, Master, you fashioned man and established him as king of creation, and said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone on the earth. Let us make him a helper like himself.’ And taking one of his ribs you fashioned a woman. When Adam saw her he said, ‘Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. She will be called ‘woman’ because she was taken from her man. For this reason a man will leave behind his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’. And ‘Those whom God has joined together, let no human separate’. Now, Master, Lord our God, send down your heavenly grace also on these servants of yours, N. and M., and grant that this handmaid of yours may be subject in all things to her husband and that this servant of yours may be the head of his wife, so that they may live in accordance with your will. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Abraham and Sara. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Isaac and Rebecca. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Jacob and all the Patriarchs. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Joseph and Aseneth. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Moses and Sepphora. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Joachim and Anna. <br> Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Zachary and Elisabeth. <br> Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved Noë in the Ark. <br> Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved Jonas in the belly of the whale. <br> Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved the three holy Youths from the fire, by sending down on them dew from heaven. <br> And let the joy come upon them that the blessed Helen had when she found the precious Cross. <br> Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered Enoch, Sem and Elias. <br> Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered the holy Forty Martyrs, sending down on them crowns from heaven. <br> Remember also, Lord our God, the parents who have brought them up, for the prayers of parents make firm the foundations of households. <br> Remember, Lord our God, your servants the groomsmen and bridesmaids, who have come together to share this joy. <br> Remember, Lord our God, your servant N. and your servant M., and bless them. <br> Give them the fruit of the womb, fair offspring, concord of soul and body. <br> Exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon, like a well-cultured vine. <br> Grant then rich harvest, so that, having all sufficiency for themselves, they may overflow into every good work that is also well-pleasing to you, and that they may see their children’s children like newly planted olive trees all around their table. And, having been well pleasing to you, may they shine like beacons in heaven, in you our Lord, to whom belong all glory might, honour and worship, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Yoke them together in likeness of mind. Crown them into one flesh. Grant them fruit of the womb, enjoyment of fair offspring.

Brethren, give thanks at all times for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, making yourselves subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is head of the wife, as Christ too is head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body. But as the Church is subject to Christ, so wives must be also to their own husbands in everything. Husbands love your own wives, as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for her, that he might sanctify her, having purified her with the washing of water with a word, that he might present the Church to himself glorious, without spot or wrinkle or anything similar, but that she might be holy and unblemished. Thus husbands must love their own wives like their own bodies. One who loves his own wife loves himself, for no one hates their own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as the Lord does the Church, because we are members of his body, from his flesh and from his bones. ‘For this reason a man will abandon his father and mother and be attached to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ This is a great mystery, I mean concerning Christ and the Church. However let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife respect her husband.

At that time, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage. When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, ‘They have no wine’. Jesus said to her. ‘Woman, why do you trouble me? My hour has not yet come.’ His mother said to the servants, ‘Whatever he tells you, do it.’ Now there were six stone water jars standing there for the Jewish ritual of purification, holding twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the jars with water.’ And they filled them to the brim. He said to them, ‘Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward of the feast. They took it. When the chief steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it had come from — but the servants who had drawn the water knew — he summoned the bridegroom and said to him, ‘Everyone puts out the good wine first, and when people are drunk, then he puts out the worse. But you have kept the good wine until now.’ This was the beginning of the signs that Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and he manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him.

Master, lover of mankind, King of the ages and Creator of all things, who destroyed the middle wall of enmity and granted peace to the human race, we pray and implore you, look on your servants, M. and N., pour your blessing upon them.
