Most merciful Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, through the prayers of our all-pure Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary; by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross; through the protection of the honoured Bodiless Powers of heaven; through the intercessions of the honoured, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John; of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of the holy, glorious and triumphant Martyrs; of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers and Mothers; (the Patron Saint of the Church), of the holy and righteous Forebears of God, Joachim and Anna, of Saint N, whose memory we celebrate, and of all your Saints: make our supplication acceptable; grant us forgiveness of our offences; shelter us in the shelter of your wings; drive from us every foe and enemy; make our life peaceful. Lord, have mercy on us and on your world, and save our souls, for you are good and love mankind.

Immediately after the Prayer behind the Ambo the Singers begin the Troparion of the Feast or Saint and the Priest and Deacon come from the Sanctuary as above. At the end, after The rich have become poor ..., the Singers begin Blessed be the name of the Lord ... as usual; and the Liturgy ends in the normal way. If there is a Memorial Service for the Departed it takes place immediately after The rich have become poor ..., and is followed by Blessed be the name of the Lord.
