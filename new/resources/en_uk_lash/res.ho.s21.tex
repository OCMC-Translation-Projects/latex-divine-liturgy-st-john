Of your mystical Supper, Son of God, today receive me as a communicant; for I will not speak of the Mystery to your enemies; I will not give you a kiss, like Judas; but like the Thief I confess you: Remember me, Lord, in your Kingdom.

How shall I, the unworthy, enter among the splendours of your Saints? For if I dare to enter with them into the bridal chamber, my dress convicts me, for it is not a wedding garment, and I shall be bound and cast out by the Angels. Cleanse the stain of my soul, Lord, and save me, as you love humankind.

Master, lover of humankind, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, do not let these holy Mysteries be for my condemnation because I am unworthy, but rather for the cleansing and sanctification of both soul and body and as a pledge of the life and kingdom to come. It is good for me to cleave to God, to place in the Lord the hope of my salvation.
