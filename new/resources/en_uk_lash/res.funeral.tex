One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection of the of the God of heaven; will say to the Lord: You are my protector and my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the hunters’ snare, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings, and under his feathers you will have hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that flies by day; of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap or of the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right, but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling, because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon. Because he/she hoped in me, I shall deliver him/her; I shall shelter him/her, because he/she knew my name. He/she will cry to me, and I shall hear him/her, I am with him/her in trouble; I shall rescue him/her and glorify him/her. I shall fill him/her with length of days, and show him/her my salvation.
