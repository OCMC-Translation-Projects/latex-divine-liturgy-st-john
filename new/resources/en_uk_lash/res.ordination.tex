A Deacon is ordained by a Bishop late in the Liturgy, following the Consecration of the Holy Gifts, because his role is to assist with the distribution of Holy Communion. A Deacon is elevated to Presbyter by a Bishop prior to the Consecration, because it is his distinguishing grace to invoke the Holy Spirit. A Bishop is ordained before the Scriptural readings, because it is his special role to preach and teach the Gospel, and also in order to ordain others. Whereas a single Bishop suffices for the ordination of a Deacon or Priest, the Holy Canons require that at least three Bishops participate in the elevation of a Priest to the Episcopacy.

An Episcopal ordination begins before the Divine Liturgy, when the Bishop-elect, vested in an epitrachelion and phelonion and carrying the Holy Gospel, is escorted by two deacons through the Royal Doors to the center of the Solea. There the Archbishop and his concelebrant Hierarchs are seated on their thrones, facing the Sanctuary. The Bishop-elect opens the Holy Gospel and reads a document containing his Confession of Faith.
