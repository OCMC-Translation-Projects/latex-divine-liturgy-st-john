Lord, hear my prayer. In your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground, made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit within me was despondent, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works. On the works of your hands I would meditate. I stretched out my hands towards you. For you my soul was like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, Lord, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have fled to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name’s sake, O Lord, you will make me live. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of affliction, slay my enemies in your mercy and destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am your servant.

For dedication to be honoured is an old law, and it is good; but rather should what is new be honoured through dedication, for islands are dedicated to God, as Isaias says, which are to be understood as the Churches from the nations, which have lately been established and received stability fixed on God. Therefore let us too celebrate spiritually the festival of the present Dedication.

Brethren, the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from One. For this reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, ‘I will proclaim your name to my brethren, in the midst of the church I will praise you’. And again, ‘I will put my trust in him’. And again, ‘Here am I, and children whom God has given me’. Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear he did not take on himself the nature of Angels, but he took on that of the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brethren in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. For because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.

For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.’

Brethren, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies. In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot speak now in detail. Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties; but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people.

But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, ‘Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.’ But Jesus answered her, ‘Martha, Martha, you are anxious and fret about many things; one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.’ As he said this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, ‘Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that you sucked!’ But he said, ‘Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!’

They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness, and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds, and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness, and rejoice at your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord, and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, they will tell of your power. To make known your power to the children of humankind, the glory the majesty of your kingdom. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and will hear their supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on age.

Bishop: God without beginning and eternal, who brought all things out of nothing into being, who dwell in unapproachable light, who have heaven as your throne, earth as your footstool, you gave Moses commandment and model, placed in Beseleêl a spirit of wisdom and made them able to complete the Tabernacle of Witness, in which were the ordinances of worship, the images and patterns of the truth. To Solomon you granted breadth and largeness of heart and through him you raised up the Temple of old. For your holy and all-praised Apostles you dedicated anew worship in Spirit and the grace of the true Tabernacle, and through them you planted in all the world your holy Churches and altars, O Lord of powers, for sacred sacrifices without shedding of blood to be offered you. Now you have been well-pleased for this Church also to be built in the name of Saint N. to your glory and that of your only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit. Immortal and bountiful King, remember your acts of compassion and mercy, for they are from all time, and do not abhor us, befouled as we are with a multitude of sins, do not profane your covenant because of our uncleanness, but disregard our offences, give us strength and ability by the grace and visitation of your holy and life-giving Spirit, to accomplish without condemnation the dedication of this Church and to effect the consecration of the Altar within it, so that, blessing you in it with psalms and hymns and spiritual liturgies, we may at all times magnify your compassion. Yes, Master, Lord, God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth, hear us sinners as we entreat you, and send down your all-holy, worshipful and all-powerful Spirit and sanctify this House. Fill it with unending light; choose it for your dwelling; make it a tabernacle of your glory; adorn it with your divine and supernatural gifts of grace; set it as a haven for the storm-tossed, a place of healing for the passions, a refuge for the weak, a place that puts demons to flight. Let your eyes be open to it by day and night and your ears attentive to the supplication of those who enter it with fear of you and with devotion, and who call upon your all-honoured and worshipful name. Whatever they ask of you, you will hear in heaven above, show mercy and be gracious to them. Keep it unshaken until the consummation of the age and declare the Altar within it to be a Holy of Holies by the power and operation of your Holy Spirit. Glorify it more than the Mercy Seat under the law, so that the sacred rites performed on it may reach your holy and spiritual altar above the heavens and bring us the grace of your most pure overshadowing. For we take courage, not in the work of our unworthy hands, but in your ineffable loving-kindness.

Accept us now also, bountiful Master, as we pray, not because we are worthy to ask for such great things, but that your surpassing loving-kindness may be revealed. For you have never ceased to bestow your bounties in countless ways upon the human race, but made the summit of your gifts the Coming of your Only-begotten Son. He appeared on earth and made the light of salvation shine for those in darkness, he offered himself as a sacrifice for us, and became the whole world’s expiation, making us sharers in his own resurrection. And, when he had been taken up into heaven, he clothed his Disciples and Apostles, as he had promised, with power from on high, which is the Holy Spirit, worshipful and all-powerful, who proceeds from you, God and Father. Made powerful through the Holy Spirit in deed and word, they handed on the baptism of filial adoption, raised up Churches, founded Altars, laid down the rules and laws of Priesthood. Holding fast to their tradition, we sinners fall before you, the eternal God, and we implore you, O Compassionate: Fill this House, which has been built to sing your praise, with your glory, and declare this Altar here to be a Holy of Holies, so that we, as we stand before it, as before the dread throne of your kingdom, may worship you without condemnation, offering up supplications for ourselves and for all your people and offering to your loving-kindness the sacrifice with out shedding of blood, for pardon of sins voluntary and involuntary, guidance in life, establishment of a good way of living, fulfilment of all justice.

Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honour than the house. For every house is built by some one, but the builder of all things is God.

Bishop: At that time, it was the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, ‘How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ Jesus answered them, ‘I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.’
