﻿FUNERAL SERVICE DURING BRIGHT WEEK.
}%
\itKey{p0002}{
When a brother falls asleep in the Lord during Holy Bright Week, we do not sing the usual funeral service, but rather the Resurrection Service. This service is also sung on the day of the leave taking of the feast of Pascha. During the period after Bright Week until the leave-taking, we sing the usual service but replace “O Holy God, holy and  mighty...” with “Christ is risen...” From the home until the temple again we sing “Christ is risen...” Instead of “Let us give a parting farewell...” we sing “Today is the day of Resurrection...”. This is also sung until reaching the grave.

O God of all spirits and of every flesh, who has trampled down death and has overcome the devil, bestowing life to your world; do you yourself, O Lord, give rest to the soul of your departed servant [name] in a place of light, in a place of green pasture, in a place of refreshment, from where pain, sorrow and mourning have fled away. Every sin committed by him/her in thought, word or deed, do you as our good and man-befriending God forgive: for there is no man that shall live and not sin, only you alone are without sin. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is truth.
