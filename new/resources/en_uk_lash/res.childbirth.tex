O God, the Father Almighty, through the clear proclamation of your Prophet Isaiah you foretold to us the incarnation from a Virgin of your only-begotten Son and our God. In the last times by your own choice and with the cooperation of the Holy Spirit, in your endless compassion, you consented to become an infant from her, for the salvation of us mortals. In accordance with the custom of your holy law, after the completion of the days of purification, you consented, being yourself the true law-giver, to be brought to the Temple, and you submitted to be held in the arms of the righteous Symeon. This mystery was prefigured and made manifest to us in the vision of the Prophet Isaiah through the burning coal carried with tongs, and this same mystery we the faithful imitate by grace. And now do you, the same Lord who guard the infants, bless this child (these children) together with his (her) (their) parents and make him (her) (them) worthy, at the appropriate time, of rebirth by water and the Spirit, number him (her) (them) among the flock of your reason-endowed sheep who are called by the name of your Christ.
