Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, shepherd and lamb, who takes away the sins of the world, who forgave the loan to the two debtors and granted remission of her sins to the sinful woman; do you yourself, O Lord, loose, remit, forgive the sins, the transgressions and errors, both voluntary and involuntary, known or unknown, which have been committed through violation and disobedience by these your servants. And if they, being human, bearing flesh and dwelling in the world, were deceived in anything by the Devil, either in word or deed, knowingly or unknowingly, if they broke the word of a priest, or came under the curse of a priest, or fell under their own anathema, or have broken any oath, do you, the same good and loving Master, be pleased to set free these your servants by your word, granting them forgiveness from their own anathema and oath, according to your great mercy. Yes, Master, Lord and lover of mankind, hear us as we pray to your goodness for these your servants, and, in your great mercy, overlook all their faults; deliver them from eternal punishment; for you have said, O Master: ‘Whatever you pronounce unforgiven on earth shall remain unforgiven in heaven, and whatever you forgive on earth shall be forgiven in heaven.’

O God, our Savior, who through your prophet Nathan granted forgiveness to David when he repented of his transgressions, and accepted Manasseh’s prayer of repentance; do you, the same Lord, who forgives wrongdoings and overlooks transgressions, accept also, in your customary love for mankind, your servant (Name) who repents of all the offenses he (she) has committed, and overlook everything that he (she) has done. For you have said, Lord: ‘I have never desired the death of the sinner, but rather that he should turn back and live;’ and you have commanded that sins should be forgiven even up to seventy times seven times. For your greatness is incomparable and your mercy limitless, and if you were to keep strict account of our iniquities, who could stand before you?

Lord Jesus Christ, our God, through Nathan the Prophet you forgave David, the ancestor of the Lord God, the offences which he had committed, saying to him, 'The Lord has taken away your sin, because you said, I have sinned before the Lord;' you felt compassion for Peter when he wept bitterly for his denial and confessed it, and you accepted his tears; you also accepted the harlot who wept fervently and shed tears on your most pure feet and dried them with her hair, and you said to her, 'Woman, your sins are forgiven you;' you restored Manasseh king of Zion after he repented in Babylon and confessed to you about the bronze idol; you received with joy the returning Prodigal after he had wasted all his wealth with harlots and had been forced to eat the same food as the pigs, and you slaughtered the fatted calf for him, kissing him and placing a ring on his finger; you accepted the repentance and the humility of the Publican rather than the prayer of the boastful Pharisee, and justified him by your word; you accepted even the repentance of the thief on the Cross; you said, 'Confess your sins to one another.' In this way, after calling us, you remain faithful and just, and forgive us everything and cleanse us from every pollution of flesh and spirit. Do you, O Lord all-good and most merciful, forgive everything that my spiritual child (Name) has confessed to my humble person before you with a contrite heart, both in the present age and in the age to come; and make him (her) worthy to stand uncondemned before you, for you are blessed unto the ages of ages.
