We venerate your most pure icon, loving Lord, as we ask pardon for our offences, Christ God. For by your own choice you were well pleased to ascend the Cross in the flesh, to deliver from the slavery of the enemy those whom you had fashioned. Therefore with thanksgiving we cry to you: you have filled all things with joy, our Saviour, by coming to save the world.
