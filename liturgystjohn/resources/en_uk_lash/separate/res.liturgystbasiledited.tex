\itKey{p0003}{
Take note, that the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated only ten times in the year: on the five Sundays of Great Lent [but not on Palm Sunday], on Holy and Great Thursday, On Holy and Great Saturday, on the Eve of the Nativity of Christ [Christmas Eve], on the Eve of Theophany and on St. Basil’s day [1st January].
}%
\itKey{p0004}{
If the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated with Vespers, the Priest shall say, “Blessed is the kingdom of the Father...” and the Reader shall read the introductory Psalm 103 [104]. Vespers shall be sung as usual according to the typikon up to the readings from the Old Testament. After the readings, the Priest [or Deacon] shall say, “Let us pray unto the Lord.” And then the Priest shall say, “For Thou our God art Holy and to Thee we ascribe glory...” and here beginneth The Divine Liturgy of St. Basil with the readings of the Apostle and Gospel and the rest of the Liturgy as usual.

And with these blessed Powers, O Master and lover of mankind, we also cry aloud and say: Holy indeed and most Holy are You, and no bounds are there to the majesty of Your holiness; and just are You in all Your works, for in righteousness and true judgement hast You ordered all things for us. For after You have formed man of the dust of the earth, and honoured him, O God, with Your own image, You didst set him in the paradise of delight and didst promise unto him immortal life and the enjoyment of eternal good things in the keeping of Your commandments. But when he disobeyed You, his true God, which created him, and was allured by the deceit  of the serpent, and slain by his own trespasses, You, O Lord, in righteous judgement didst cast him out of paradise into this world, and didst return him to the earth from whence he was taken: dispensing for him salvation by regeneration, which is in Your Christ Himself. For You, O Good One, didst not wholly forsake Your creature which You have made, neither didst You forget the works of Your hands, but because of Your tender mercy in divers manners didst visit him. Prophets didst You send, mighty works hast You performed through Your saints which have been well-pleasing unto You in every generation: You hast spoken unto us by the mouth of Your servants the prophets, foretelling unto us the salvation to come. The law You gave  to help us, angels You didst appoint to guard us. And when the fullness of the time was come You didst speak unto us by Your Son Himself, by whom also You made the worlds. Who, being the brightness of Your glory, and the express image of Your person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, thought it not robbery to be equal with You, God and Father. But being God pre-eternal did He yet showed Himself upon earth, and conversed with men: and being incarnate of the holy Virgin He emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of the body of our humility that He might fashion us like the image of His glory. For inasmuch as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so it seemed good unto Your only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of You, O God and Father, made of a woman, the holy Mother of God and ever-Virgin Mary, made under the law, to condemn sin in His flesh, that they who die in Adam may be quickened in Your Christ Himself. Who dwelling in this world gave saving commandments and having turned us from the deceits of idols, hath brought us unto the knowledge of You, the true God and Father, having possessed us unto Himself for a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. Who hath cleansed us with water and sanctified us by the Holy Spirit, giving Himself a ransom unto death, wherein we were held, sold under sin: and by the Cross having descended into Hades, that He might fill all things with Himself, He loosed the pains of death: and being risen again the third day He made a way for all flesh unto the resurrection of the dead, for since it was not possible that the author of life should be held by corruption, He became the first-fruits of them that had fallen asleep, the firstborn from the dead: that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. And ascending into heaven He sat down on the right hand of Your Majesty on high, from whence He shall come again to render to every man according to His deeds. Who also hath left unto us for a remembrance of His saving passion these things which we here set forth according to His commandments. For when He was  about to go forth to His voluntary and ever-memorable and life-giving death, in the night that He gave Himself for the life of the world, took bread in His sacred and most pure hands and when He had shown it unto You, O God and Father, and having given thanks, He blessed it, hallowed it and brake it:

O You who dost accept as a sacrifice of praise and a worship pleasing to You, this reasonable and bloodless sacrifice, from them that call upon You with their whole heart, O Christ our God, O Lamb and Son of God, who takes away the sin of the world: the blameless calf, not bearing the yoke of sin and yet of Your own will was sacrificed for us. Who being broken, yet is not divided, who is eaten and never consumed, but sanctifies them that eat thereof. Who in remembrance of Your voluntary passion and Your life-giving resurrection on the third day hast rendered us to be partakers of Your ineffable and heavenly and dread mysteries, Your holy Body and Your precious Blood. Preserve us Your servants, the Deacons, those in authority over us, and all the people here present in Your holiness. And grant us at all times and at every moment to meditate on Your righteousness, that being guided toward Your will and having done that which is well-pleasing to You, we may be accounted worthy to stand on Your right hand when You comes to judge both the quick and the dead. Deliver our brethren in captivity, visit the sick, direct from all danger those at sea, and give rest to the souls of them that have departed before us in the hope of life everlasting, where the light of Your countenance watches over them, and give ear to all that pray for Your help.
